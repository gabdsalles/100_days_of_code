<h1>The Best Movies According to Gabriel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>Bong Joon-ho criticizes social inequality on Korea, telling the story of a
family that start to work in the house of a very wealthy family, faking their 
identities.</p>
<h3>Lost In Translation</h3>
<p>It is kind of sad, but a very introspective movie, starring Scarlett Johansoon
and Bill Murray, recorded in a Tokyo hotel.</p>
<h3>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</h3>
<p>The best coming-of-age movie i've ever seen, one of my favorite movie genres.</p>
